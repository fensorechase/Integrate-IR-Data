# Integrate-IR-Data
This program accepts user input for the upper &amp; lower limits of integration. Then, it parses through a folder (path modifiable below) full of .csv files, integrates data between the user-defined integration limits, and writes the area under the curve to an output file called "origname___i.csv" in the same directory as path.

# Instructions to Run
$ python integrate-2-py input-filename.csv
